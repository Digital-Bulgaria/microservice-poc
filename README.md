# Intoduction

This is a very early PoC implementation of a microservice architecture. 
In *this moment* it is an active project and consist of:

* API Gateway Service - uses Spring Cloud Netflix - Zuul Proxy. Routes API calls, load balancer, circuit breaker, avoids CORS issues.
* Registry service - uses Spring Cloud Netflix - Eureka. Visible only internally and not via the gateway.
* Product service - a spring boot app exposing REST API. Operates as a resource server communicating with the `uaa-service`.
* UAA service - authentication server and user management.
* Configuration service - a service that holds the configurations for the remaining services.
* Monitoring service - a monitoring service which gives an overview of potential failures.

The project is organized in a gradle multi module project.
